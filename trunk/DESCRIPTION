Description: This package implements a state-of-the-art version of the Particle Swarm Optimisation (PSO) algorithm, with a special focus on the calibration of environmental models. hydroPSO is model-independent, allowing the user to easily interface any model code with the calibration engine (PSO). hydroPSO includes a series of controlling options and PSO variants to fine-tune the performance of the calibration engine. An advanced sensitivity analysis function together with user-friendly plotting summaries facilitate the interpretation and assessment of the calibration results. Bugs reports/comments/questions are very welcomed.
