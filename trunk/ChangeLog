        o 'hydroPSO'  : -) SPSO 2011 capable, which includes: (check the latest \url{clerc.maurice.free.fr/pso/SPSO_descriptions.pdf})
                           * new default value for swarm size (npart=40),
                           * new equation for updating the velocity ( V[t+1] = w*V + Gr -x + alea_sphere(Gr, ||Gr-x||) ), 
                           * new initialization of the velocity ( Vini = U(lower-Xini, upper-Xini) )
                           * new confinement of the velocity ( V[t+1] = -0.5 * V[t], when x[t+1] > x_max | x[t+1] < x_min )
                           * optional normalisation of parameter values
        
                        -) improved performance: ~ 33% faster for 32-bit machines and 38% faster for 64-bit machines.
                           Tested on 10-, 20- and 30-D benchmark functions with 'write2disk=FALSE'.                            
                        -) new 'normalise' parameter for the 'control' variable, in order to improve the performance when the search space is not 
                           a hypercube
                        -) 'fn' argument now can be any R function or a character. In the latter case, it can be "hydromod" or the name of a 
                           valid R function. In previous versions of 'hydroPSO' only a character type was accepted.
                        -) now it handles models with sub-daily time step and with sub-daily observations (thanks to O. Rakovec !).
                           Suggested dependence on hydroGOF >= 0.3-5 and hydroTSM >= 0.3-6
                        -) new output file 'BestModel_out.txt', with the model outputs corresponding to the best parameter set. 
                           Only available when 'fn.name=="hydromod"'
                        -) normalised swarm radius now it is computed using the median distance of all the particles  the global best, instead of 
                           using the maximum distance (as proposed in Evers and Ghalia 2009). This was done in order to make easier the 
                           identification of the stagnation point for activating regrouping
                        -) when 'use.RG=TRUE', the default values for 'RG.thr', 'RG.r', and 'RG.miniter' were changed (related to the change in the 
                           computation of swarm radius), from 1.1E-4, 0.8 and 5 to 1E-5, 2 and 100, respectively
                        -) argument 'method' now allows the following 3 new values: 'spso2007', 'spso2011' and 'canonical', which set the values of the PSO 
                           engine to the ones of the SPSO 2007, SPSO 2011 and the canonical one, respectively. 
                        -) argument 'method'. The old (default) value 'pso' was replaced by the new (default) value 'spso2011'
                        -) argument 'Vini.type' now allows 2 new values for setting the initial velocity of the particles according to the equation 
                           specified in the SPSO 2011: 'random2011' and 'lhs2011', which use a uniform distribution or with a Latin-hypercube 
                           sampling, respectively.
                        -) argument 'Vini.type'. The old values 'random' and 'lhs' were replaced by 'random2007' and 'lhs2007', in order to make 
                           clear that it follows the equation described in SPSO 2007.
                        -) argument 'Vini.type', when missing its value depends on the value of the 'method' argument:
                           method == 'spso2007' => Vini.type='random2007' 
                           method != 'spso2007' => Vini.type='random2011'
                        -) argument 'Xini.type', now its default value is 'random' instead of 'lhs', in order to make it compatible with the default
                           value for 'method' (method='spso2011')
                        -) argument 'npart', when missing its value depends on the value of the 'method' argument:
                           method == 'spso2007' => npart=10+2*[sqrt(n)] 
                           method != 'spso2007' => npart=40
                        -) argument 'boundary.wall' now allows the following new values: 'absorbing2011', which set 'boundary.wall' to the 
                           absorbing condition specified in the SPSO 2011
                        -) argument 'boundary.wall'. The old value 'absorbing' was replaced by 'absorbing2007', in order to make clear that is 
                           follows the equation described in SPSO 2007.
                        -) argument 'boundary.wall', when missing its value depends on the value of the 'method' argument:
                           method == 'spso2007' => boundary.wall='absorbing2007' 
                           method != 'spso2007' => boundary.wall='absorbing2011'
                        -) in the documentation, default values are now mentioned for each argument of 'control'.
                        -) the 'PSO_logfile.txt' output file now contains information about: 'best.update', 'random.update', 'Xini.type', 'Vini.type'
                           In addition, information about 'IW.type' and 'IW.exp' is now written only when 'length(IW.w) > 1'
                        -) output file 'BestParamPerParticle.txt' now has the GoF as first column (previously it was the last one)
                        -) fixed velocity equation for 'boundary.wall="reflecting"' :
                                       ver <= 0.1-58   ->    ver >= 0.2-0
                             v[t+1] :   v[t]           ->      -v[t]                 (when x[t+1] > x_max | x[t+1] < x_min )
                        -) changed velocity equation for 'boundary.wall="damping"' :
                                       ver <= 0.1-58   ->    ver >= 0.2-0
                             v[t+1] :   v[t]           ->      -v[t]                 (when x[t+1] > x_max | x[t+1] < x_min )
                        -) when the control argument 'out.with.fit.iter' (not used so far) is set to TRUE, the number of iterations returned
                           correspond to the effective number of iterations carried out, not the maximum defined by 'maxit'
                        -) observed values are now correctly written to disk for sub-daily models
                        -) the package now depends on R >= 2.13.0, not 2.10.0 as in previous releases, in order to be consistent with the 
                           byte-compiler setting of the package
                        -) fixed some (very unlikely) error when 'IW.type="aiwf"'
                              

        o Running 'hydroPSO' >= 0.2-0 with default settings will produce DIFFERENT RESULTS from those obtained with 'hydroPSO' <= 0.1-58, due to the 
                               following changes in default values:
                                                ver <= 0.1-58   ->    ver >= 0.2-0
                              -) npart        : 10+2*[sqrt(n)]  ->   40
                              -) Xini.type    : 'lhs'           ->  'random'
                              -) Vini.type    : 'lhs2007'       ->  'random2011'
                              -) boundary.wall: 'reflecting'    ->  'absorbing2011'
                            
                              -) TVc1.type    : 'non-linear'    ->  'linear' (no effect, because 'use.TVc1=FALSE' by default)
                              -) TVc2.type    : 'non-linear'    ->  'linear' (no effect, because 'use.TVc2=FALSE' by default)
                              -) TVlambda.type: 'non-linear'    ->  'linear' (no effect, because 'use.TVlambda=FALSE' by default)

                              -) boundary.wall: 'reflecting' in  hydroPSO ver <= 0.1-58 is not longer equivalent to 'reflecting' in 
                                 hydroPSO ver >= 0.1-58
                               
        o 'hydromod'        : -) now it is able to handle sub-daily models
                              -) if the 'hydroGOF' package is not available, a simple correlation plot is produced between observations and 
                                 the best simulation
                              -) improved documentation 
                              -) removed default value for 'exe.name' (previously './swat.out')

        o 'test_functions'  : -) new benchmark functions: 
                                 'schwefel'    : Schwefel function
                                 'ssphere'     : shifted Sphere (CEC 2005), 
                                 'srosenbrock' : shifted Rosenbrock (CEC 2005), 
                                 'srastrigin'  : shifted Rastrigin (CEC 2005),  
                                 'sgriewank'   : shifted Griewank (CEC 2005),  
                                 'sackley'     : shifted Ackley (CEC 2005),   
                                 'sschwefel1_2': shifted Schwefel's Problem 1.2 (CEC 2005)  
                                 
                               -) added equations, description and references for each test function.

        o 'plot_convergence': -) the label 'Gbest' was replaced by "Global Optimum' in the title of the plot and in the label of the 'y' axis, in
                                 order to make it more intuitive to people non-familiar with PSO
        o 'read_particles'  : -) new argument 'do.pairs' (by default 'do.pairs=FALSE'), to control if the correlation matrix among parameters has to be plotted or not
                                 (up to hydroPSO <=0.1.58 it was always plotted)

        o 'plot_particles'  : -) new argument 'do.pairs' (by default 'do.pairs=FALSE'), to control if the correlation matrix among parameters has to be plotted or not
                                 (up to hydroPSO <=0.1.58 it was always plotted)
                              -) arguments 'MinMax' and 'beh.thr' are now passed to 'plot_NparOF'
                              -) arguments 'gofs', 'MinMax' and 'beh.thr' are now passed to 'params2ecdf'

        o 'plot_results'    : -) new argument 'do.pairs' (by default 'do.pairs=FALSE'), to control if the correlation matrix among parameters has to be plotted or not
                                 (up to hydroPSO <=0.1.58 it was always plotted)
                              -) default value for 'alpha' argument was changed from 1 to 0.65

        o 'plot_out'        : -) argument 'MinMax' is not required any more!
                              -) argument 'sim' may also be 'integer' (before it had to be 'numeric', which does not allow 'integer' objects !)  

        o 'plot_NparOF'     : -) new argument 'beh.thr' to allow selecting only behavioral parameter sets
                              -) argument 'MinMax' now accepts a NULL value (default)
                              -) default value for 'alpha' argument was changed from 1 to 0.65

        o 'plot_2parOF'     : -) default value for 'alpha' argument was changed from 1 to 0.65

        o 'params2ecdf'     : -) new arguments 'gofs', 'MinMax' and 'beh.thr' 
                            
        o new function 'pest2hydroPSO' for importing PEST input files into hydroPSO
        o new function 'hydroPSO2pest' for exporting hydroPSO input files to PEST
        
        
0.1-58	14-Sep-2012
        o 'hydroPSO'      : -) 'random.update' is now ONLY used when 'best.update="async". In hydroPSO 0.1-57 'random.update' was set to TRUE 
                               by default, independent of the 'best.update="sync" value.
                            -) argument values are now effectively checked for: 'MinMax', 'Xini.type', 'Vini.type', 'best.update', 'boundary.wall', 
                               'topology', 'IW.type', 'TVc1.type', 'TVc2.type', 'TVlambda.type'.
                            -) more and better examples
        o 'test_functions': -) name of the "rastrigrin" function was changed to its correct name of "rastrigin", and modified in all the examples.
                               The old (and wrong) name 'rastrigrin' is kept only for backwards compatibility.
                            -) The definition of the 'schafferF6' function was corrected (changed) from:
                                     0.5 + ( ( sin( sqrt( sum( x^2 ) ) ) )^2 - 0.5) / ( ( 1 + 0.01*sum(x^2) )^2 )                             
                               to:
                                     0.5 + ( ( sin( sqrt( sum( x^2 ) ) ) )^2 - 0.5) / ( ( 1 + 0.001*sum(x^2) )^2 )
        
0.1-57	29-Jun-2012
        o 'hydroPSO'    : -) added '...' parameter. It is only used when 'fn' is different from "hydromod". This is only done for 'optim' compatibility.
                          -) fixed small bug related to improper PSO evolution when 'best.update'=="async" (NOT the default option !) 
                             AND (topology!="gbest" | method!="pso")
                          -) new 'random.update' parameter for the 'control' variable, in order to allow random update of personal/global best
                          -) default value of the inertia weight 'IW' was changed from (linearly decreasing) IW.w= c(1.2, 0.4) to 'IW.w=1/(2*log(2))'
                          -) default value for the time-varying c1 was changed from (non-linearly decreasing) 'TVc1.rng= c(2.2, 1.8)' to 
                             'TVc1.rng= c(1.28, 1.05)'. However, by default 'use.TVc1= FALSE' still.
                          -) default value for the time-varying c2 was changed from (non-linearly increasing) 'TVc1.rng= c(1.8, 2.2)' to 
                             'TVc2.rng= c(1.05, 1.28)'. However, by default 'use.TVc2= FALSE' still.
                          -) default value for the time-varying lambda was changed from (non-linearly decreasing) 'TVlambda.rng= c(0.9, 0.1)' to 
                             'TVlambda.rng= c(1, 0.25)'. However, by default 'use.TVlambda= FALSE' still.
                          -) default value for the exponent of the time-varying lambda was changed from 'TVlambda.exp= 1.7' to 'TVlambda.exp= 1'.
                             However, by default 'use.TVlambda= FALSE' still.
                          -) source code was tidy up
        o 'plot_out'    : -) Fixed error that appeared when the 'plot_out' function was called from an R script running directly on the OS console 
                             (not within the R editor), with the following error message:
                             "Error in plot2(x = sim, y = obs, plot.type = "single", main = paste("Daily",  : 
                              could not find function "hasArg"
                             Calls: plot_results -> plot_out -> ggof -> plot2"
        o 'plot_results': -) Same as immediately above (because 'plot_results' internally calls 'plot_out')
                           
                             
0.1-56	14-Jun-2012
        o 'hydroPSO'    : -) much less memory consumption for large values of 'maxit' and/or 'npart' (thanks to  P. Smith for reporting it !)
                             The files 'BestParamPerIter.txt', 'PbestPerIter.txt', 'LocalBestPerIter.txt', 'Velocities.txt' are now written at the end of 
                             each iteration, and not at the end of the main algorithm (so the corresponding local variables were removed)
                          -) the convergence of the algorithm controlled by 'reltol' is now defined by : 
                             
                                        abs(reltol) <= abs(best.pbest[iter] - best.pbest[iter-1]), 
                             
                             instead of:
                                        reltol <= [ gbest(iter) / ( gbest(iter-1) +reltol ) ]
                                        
                          -) 'PbestPerIter.txt' output file: now it has an additional first column labelled "Iter", with the iteration number

     -) new topology 'random', based on SPSO 2007, described in Clerc 2005
     -) new methods 'fips' & 'wfips'
     -) new 'convergence', 'message' and  'counts' ( function.calls, iterations, regrouping ) fields added to the output of hydroPSO
     -) name of the output element 'Best.Parameter.Values' was changed to 'par' (towards 'optim' compatibility)
     -) name of the output element 'Global.Best.Value' was changed to 'value' (towards 'optim' compatibility)
     -) name of the output element 'Global.Best.Position' was changed to 'best.particle' (towards 'optim' compatibility)
     -) Velocity is now initialized as in SPSO 2007 (Vini= [ U(lower, upper) - Xini] / 2 )

     -) New 'read_convergence' and 'plot_convergence' functions
     -) 'plotparam': thanks to Rodrigo Rojas'collaboration, this function was greatly improved, in order to get (almost) journal quality by default
     -) 'of-out.txt' changed to 'of_out.txt', in order to avoid problems with the symbol '-'
     -) 'PSO-logfile.txt' changed to 'PSO_logfile.txt', in order to avoid problems with the symbol '-'
