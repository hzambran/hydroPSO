0.3-4	11-Abr-2014
        o Package tested against R version 3.1.0 (2014-04-10) -- "Spring Dance".
        o 'lhoat'              : -) when 'normalise=TRUE' the 'ParameterSets' output is now given in the real range of each parameter, and not in the 
                                    normalised range [0, 1] as up to version 0.3.2. The 'lhoat-gof.txt' output file has always been written in the real 
                                    range of each parameter when 'normalise=TRUE'. Thanks to Romain Lardy !
                                 -) fixed error: 'Error in Thetas * (UPPER.ini - LOWER.ini) : non-conformable arrays', which was triggered when 
                                    'normalise=TRUE' & 'model.FUN="hydromod"'.
                                 -) now works correctly on Windows machines (when 'parallel="parallelWin"')
                                    (thanks to Dipangkar Kundu !)
                                 -) fixed error : ' Error in argfun(start + i - 1L) : object 'model.out.text.file' not found', which was triggered when
                                    'parallel="parallelWin" AND 'write2disk=FALSE'
                                 -) 'parallel_logfile.txt' is now removed before start running this function (when 'parallel!="none"')
                                 -) 'parallel::makeCluster' was replaced by 'makeCluster' (and importFrom in NAMESPACE)
                                 -) 'parallel::makeForkCluster' was replaced by 'makeForkCluster' (and importFrom in NAMESPACE)
                                 -) 'parallel::detectCores' was replaced by 'detectCores' (and importFrom in NAMESPACE)
                                 -) 'parallel::clusterCall' was replaced by 'clusterCall' (and importFrom in NAMESPACE)
                                 -) 'parallel::clusterExport' was replaced by 'clusterExport' (and importFrom in NAMESPACE)
                                 -) 'parallel::mclapply' was replaced by 'mclapply' (and importFrom in NAMESPACE)
                                 -) 'parallel::parRapply' was replaced by 'parRapply' (and importFrom in NAMESPACE)
                                 -) 'parallel::clusterApply' was replaced by 'clusterApply' (and importFrom in NAMESPACE)
                                 -) 'parallel::stopCluster' was replaced by 'stopCluster' (and importFrom in NAMESPACE)
                                 -) 'formatC' calls were wrapped into a 'suppressWarnings' statement (to avoid unnecessary warnings, due to changes in  R 3.0.2).
        o 'hydroPSO'           : -) The 'Dimension' field is now correctly written into the 'PSO_logfile.txt' when 'parallel!=none' (in version 0.3-3 the 
                                    number of cores/nodes was written instead of the dimension of the problem)
                                 -) 'parallel_logfile.txt' is now removed before start running this function (when 'parallel!="none"')
                                 -) now it shows the number of detected cores (when 'parallel!="none" and 'verbose=TRUE')
                                 -) 'parallel:::makeCluster' was replaced by 'makeCluster' (and importFrom in NAMESPACE)
                                 -) 'parallel:::makeForkCluster' was replaced by 'makeForkCluster' (and importFrom in NAMESPACE)
                                 -) 'formatC' calls were wrapped into a 'suppressWarnings' statement (to avoid unnecessary warnings, due to changes in  R 3.0.2).
        o 'wquantile'          : -) fixed error: 'Error en setTxtProgressBar(pbar, i) : object 'pbar' not found', which was triggered when 'verbose=FALSE'.
                                    Thanks to Antonio Piccolboni !
        o 'plot_NparOF'        : 'formatC' calls were wrapped into a 'suppressWarnings' statement (to avoid unnecessary warnings, due to changes in  R 3.0.2).
        o 'verification'       : 'formatC' calls were wrapped into a 'suppressWarnings' statement (to avoid unnecessary warnings, due to changes in  R 3.0.2).
        o 'ModifyInputFile'    : 'formatC' calls were wrapped into a 'suppressWarnings' statement (to avoid unnecessary warnings, due to changes in  R 3.0.2).
        o 'plot_results'       : 'x11()' was replaced by 'dev.new()'
        o 'plot_particles'     : 'x11()' was replaced by 'dev.new()'
        o 'params2ecdf.default': 'x11()' was replaced by 'dev.new()'
        o 'read_out'           : 'require(zoo)' was reaplaced by '!is.na( match("zoo", installed.packages()[,"Package"] ) )'
        o 'lhs' package was moved from 'Suggests' into 'Imports' in NAMESPACE file.
        o 'zoo' package removed from 'Suggests' (due to changes in CRAN policies) but it stays on 'Imports' 


0.3-3	04-Jun-2013
        o 'hydroPSO'      : fixed error introduced (not intentionally, of course !) in version 0.3-2:
                            Error in FUN(1:number[[1L]], ...) : 
                              unused arguments (Particles = ...)
        o 'pest2hydroPSO' : -) typos fixed in the (automatically created) 'hydroPSO-Rscript.R' file (Thanks to Ramadan Abdel A. !):
                                *) line 38: ending comma removed
                                   out.FUN="read_output"   
                                *) line 57: added ending ', sep=""', to avoid white spaces in the filename
                                   obs.fname <- paste(model.drty, "/PSO.in/", obs.fname, sep="")  
                            -) file 'ParamFiles.txt' (automatically created) uses the correct row number for each input file.
                               Up to hydroPSO <= 0.3-2 the row number for each parameter had a shift of 1 line (e.g., it used '5' when the correct 
                               number was 4)
        o NAMESPACE: functions 'read.ParameterRanges' and 'rLHS' are now exported        

0.3-2	29-May-2013
        o 'lhoat'         : -) parallel capable
                            -) much faster than in previous hydroPSO versions, even without using the new 'parallel' option (this function was 
                               completely re-written, in order to make it parallel capable)
                            -) new 'normalise' parameter for the 'control' argument, in order to improve the sampling design when the search space is 
                               not a hypercube
                            -) new 'RelativeImportance.Norm' column at the end of the output ranking. The values in 'RelativeImportance.Norm' provide
                               normalised values of the relative importance of each parameter. The sum of all the 'RelativeImportance.Norm' must be 1. 
                               (Thanks to Rui Esteves for suggesting this feature !)
                            -) 'control' argument now allows the following new components: 'REPORT', 'parallel', 'par.nnodes', 'par.pkgs', 'normalise'
                            -) new argument '...' to allow function arguments that are kept constant during the sensitivity analysis.
        o 'pest2hydroPSO' : -) now it handles correctly cases where the fifth row of 'pst.fname' uses tab instead of white spaces as separator 
                               (Thanks to Ramadan Abdel A. !)
        o 'hydroPSO'      : -) minor bug fixed. When the goodness-of-fit value of a given parameter set is not finite, the parameter values are now 
                               correctly written into 'BestParamPerIter.txt'
                            -) when 'fn.name!="hydromod"' AND 'normalise=TRUE' (i.e., an R function and NOT an external model run from the system 
                               console) the function 'fn' is now evaluated with the correct (non normalised) parameter values 
                               (up to hydroPSO <= 0.3-1-1 'fn' was evaluated with the (non-correct) normalised values when 
                               'fn.name!="hydromod"' AND 'normalise=TRUE')
        
0.3-1-1	10-May-2013
        o Suggested package 'multicore' (superseded) was replaced by 'parallel'
        o 'hydroPSO: functions from the 'multicore' package were replaced by equivalent from the 'parallel' package (detectCores, mclapply)

0.3-1	10-May-2013
        o new 'SWAT2005.zip' file, with and updated tutorial for calibrating SWAT 2005, compatible with hydroPSO >= 0.3-0   
          The old zip file was renamed to 'SWAT2005_old.zip', which is compatible with hydroPSO <= 0.1-58
          The new 'SWAT2005.zip' file now includes a new 'swat2005.out' binary file, in order to allow running SWAT2005 in GNU/Linux machines
        o new 'MF2005.zip' file, with and updated tutorial for calibrating MODFLOW 2005, compatible with hydroPSO >= 0.3-0   
          The old zip file was renamed to 'MF2005_old.zip', which is compatible with hydroPSO <= 0.1-58    
        o 'lhoat'           : -) fixed bug that led to all parameters have the same Ranking (equal to 0) when 'fn!="hydromod"' (Thanks to Rui Esteves !)
                              -) fixed bug that led to the following error message "object 'model.out.text.fname' not found" when 'write2disk=FALSE'
                              -) 'fn' argument now can be any R function or a character. In the latter case, it can be "hydromod" or the name of a 
                                  valid R function. In previous versions of 'lhoat' only a character type was accepted (Thanks to Rui Esteves !)
        o 'hydroPSO'        : -) if a 'parallel' directory was not successfully removed during a previous run, it is removed before running the 
                                 algorithm in parallel mode again.
        o 'ReadPlot_results': updated description of the 'dp3D.names' argument    
        o 'plot_out'        : 'main' argument is not overwritten to "Observed vs 'best' Simulation" when this argument is provided and 'ptype=="ts"'
        o 'plot_results'    : 'main' argument is now (internally) passed to the 'plot_out' function.
        o 'plot_particles'  : 'main' argument is now omitted for the 3D dotty plots ('plot_NparOF' function), in order to avoid confusing (and 
                              sometimes unnecessary) titles when 'main' is too long        
        o 'plot_NparOF'     : 'main' argument was disabled, in order to avoid confusing titles when 'main is a long text

0.3-0	19-Dec-2012
        o 'hydroPSO'    : -) parallel capable (OS-independent)
                             * new argument 'parallel' to define how to parallelise the evaluation of the objective function
                             * new 'control' argument 'par.nnodes'  to define the number of cores/nodes to be used in a multi-core machine or 
                               network cluster
                             * new 'control' argument 'par.pkgs' (only needed for Windows machines) with the list of package that need to be 
                               loaded on each core/node 
                          -) Default number of particles for 'method=spso2007' was changed  from 'ceiling(10+2*sqrt(n))' to 'floor(10+2*sqrt(n))', 
                             following Clerc 2012

        o New vignette (14/Dec/2012)
                             
        o 'read_out'    : -) new argument 'nsim' used to specify the number of model outputs. It is useful when the model to be calibrated returns NA
                             instead of the simulated values for some particles (e.g., MODFLOW)
                           
        o 'read_results': -) See 'read_out' above

        o 'plot_results': -) See 'read_out' above
