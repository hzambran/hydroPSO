NEWS/ChangeLog for hydroPSO
--------------------------

0.1-57	29-Jun-2012
        o 'hydroPSO'    : -) added '...' parameter. It is only used when 'fn' is different from "hydromod". This is only done for 'optim' compatibility.
                          -) fixed small bug related to improper PSO evolution when 'best.update'=="async" (NOT the default option !) 
                             AND (topology!="gbest" | method!="pso")
                          -) new 'random.update' parameter for the 'control' variable, in order to allow random update of personal/global best
                          -) default value of the inertia weight 'IW' was changed from (linearly decreasing) IW.w= c(1.2, 0.4) to 'IW.w=1/(2*log(2))'
                          -) default value for the time-varying c1 was changed from (non-linearly decreasing) 'TVc1.rng= c(2.2, 1.8)' to 
                             'TVc1.rng= c(1.28, 1.05)'. However, by default 'use.TVc1= FALSE' still.
                          -) default value for the time-varying c2 was changed from (non-linearly increasing) 'TVc1.rng= c(1.8, 2.2)' to 
                             'TVc2.rng= c(1.05, 1.28)'. However, by default 'use.TVc2= FALSE' still.
                          -) default value for the time-varying lambda was changed from (non-linearly decreasing) 'TVlambda.rng= c(0.9, 0.1)' to 
                             'TVlambda.rng= c(1, 0.25)'. However, by default 'use.TVlambda= FALSE' still.
                          -) default value for the exponent of the time-varying lambda was changed from 'TVlambda.exp= 1.7' to 'TVlambda.exp= 1'.
                             However, by default 'use.TVlambda= FALSE' still.
                          -) source code was tidy up
        o 'plot_out'    : -) Fixed error that appeared when the 'plot_out' function was called from an R script running directly on the OS console 
                             (not within the R editor), with the following error message:
                             "Error in plot2(x = sim, y = obs, plot.type = "single", main = paste("Daily",  : 
                              could not find function "hasArg"
                             Calls: plot_results -> plot_out -> ggof -> plot2"
        o 'plot_results': -) Same as immediately above (because 'plot_results' internally calls 'plot_out')
                           
                             
0.1-56	14-Jun-2012
        o 'hydroPSO'    : -) much less memory consumption for large values of 'maxit' and/or 'npart' (thanks to  Paul Smith for reporting it !)
                             The files 'BestParamPerIter.txt', 'PbestPerIter.txt', 'LocalBestPerIter.txt', 'Velocities.txt' are now written at the end of 
                             each iteration, and not at the end of the main algorithm (so the corresponding local variables were removed)
                          -) the convergence of the algorithm controlled by 'reltol' is now defined by : abs(reltol) <= abs(best.pbest[iter] - best.pbest[iter-1]), 
                             instead of reltol <= [ gbest(iter) / ( gbest(iter-1) +reltol ) ]
                          -) 'PbestPerIter.txt' output file: now it has an additional first column labelled "Iter", with the iteration number
                          -) 'LocalBestPartPerIter.txt' output file: now it has an additional first column labelled "Iter", with the iteration number
                          -) 'BestParamPerIter.txt' output file: now it has an additional first column labelled "Iter", with the iteration number.
                             The column with the goodness-of-fit measure ('GoF') was changed from the last position to the second one 
                             (just after the new 'Iter' column)
                          -) minor change: 'gbest.fit.prior' is now initialized in 'gbest.fit' instead of 'gbest.fit + 10*reltol'
        o 'plot_results': -) 'drty.out' is now checked for existence before reading the results.
        o  Specific version numbers were added for the following suggested packages: 
           hydroGOF(>=0.3-3), hydroTSM(>= 0.3-0), zoo(>=1.7-2), xts(>=0.8-2)
               

0.1-55	11-May-2012
        o 'hydromod'     : -) 'sim' and 'obs' are now checked for time attributes when 'gof.Ini' and/or 'gof.Fin' is/are used 
                              (thanks to M. Leh for reporting !)
        o 'hydroPSO'     : -) fixed bug originated when 'gof.Ini' and/or 'gof.Fin' was/were not given as parameters for .model.FUN.args. 
                              (thanks to M. Leh for reporting !)
                               This bug originated the following error during the run of the model with the best parameter set:
                              "Error in as.Date.default(model.FUN.args[["gof.Ini"]]) : do not know how to convert 'model.FUN.args[["gof.Ini"]]' to class "Date" "
        o 'plot_results' : the default value for 'ftype' was changed from "dm" to "o", to avoid problems with time series with a resolution 
                           coarser than daily
        o 'plot_out'     : the default value for 'ftype' was changed from "dm" to "o", to avoid problems with time series with a resolution 
                           coarser than daily
