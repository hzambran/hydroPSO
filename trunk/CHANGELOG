# v 0.1.3  #
############
Release Date: XX-Jul-2010

Added Functions:

*) 'plotparam'    : It makes dotty plots of different parameter values vs the corresponding objective function value (usually for plotting the efficiencies of different parameter sets).
*) 'read.goalsf2' : It reads the files 'modelpara.out' and 'modelpara.beh' created by the GLUE algorithm of SWAT-CUP', and the 'goal.sf2' file created by the SUFI-2 algorithm of SWAT-CUP.
*) 'read.95ppusf2': It reads the SWAT-CUP file '95ppu.sf2' , which contains the 95% of predictive uncertainty corresponding to the behavioural parameter sets, with optional plot.
*) 'read.qout '   : It reads the SWAT-CUP file (by default 'q1.out')  with the simulated streamflows for all the parameter sets.
*) 'qbeh2ecdfs'   : It computes ECDFs for user-defined quantiles of the streamflows simulated with behavioural parameter sets.
*) 'wquantile'    : It computes weighted quantiles of each column of a matrix/data.frame

Modified functions:

*) read.out.rch: -) Valid values for the argument 'tstep' were changed from c('Daily', 'Monthly', 'Annual') to c('daily', 'monthly', 'annual').
                 -) The argument 'drty' was replaced by 'file', because it is more intuitive for R users.
                 -) New argument: 'rchID'.
                 -) New argument: 'verbose'   
*) read.out.sub: -) Valid values for the argument 'tstep' were changed from c('Daily', 'Monthly', 'Annual') to c('daily', 'monthly', 'annual').
                 -) The argument 'drty' was replaced by 'file', because it is more intuitive for R users.
                 -) New argument: 'subID'.
                 -) New argument: 'verbose' 
*) read.out.hru: -) Valid values for the argument 'tstep' were changed from c('Daily', 'Monthly', 'Annual') to c('daily', 'monthly', 'annual').   
                 -) The argument 'drty' was replaced by 'file', because it is more intuitive for R users.
                 -) New argument: 'hruID'.
                 -) New argument: 'verbose'            
*) read.out.rsv: -) Valid values for the argument 'tstep' were changed from c('Daily', 'Monthly', 'Annual') to c('daily', 'monthly', 'annual').
*) read.autocal: -) Valid values for the argument 'tstep' were changed from c('Daily', 'Monthly', 'Annual') to c('daily', 'monthly', 'annual').
                 -) The arguments 'drty' and 'fname' were replaced by 'file', because it is more intuitive for R users.
                 -) New argument: 'outID'.
                 -) New argument: 'verbose' 
*) read.aXX.aut: -) Valid values for the argument 'tstep' were changed from c('Daily', 'Monthly', 'Annual') to c('daily', 'monthly', 'annual').

# v 0.1.2  #
############
Release Date: 01-Dec-2009

Modified functions:

-) 'df2swat': -) The arguments 'Date' and 'date.fmt' were added as parametes of this function for allowing explicit definition of those fields in 'x.ts' (before 'Date' and '%Y-%m-%d' were used)
              -) The arguments 'id' and 'elevation' were added as parametes of this function for allowing explicit definition of those fields in 'x.gis' (before 'INDICATIVO' and 'ELEVATION' were used)
              -) The argument 'x.ts.filename' was cahnged by 'x.ts' (a data.frame insteas of a character with the filename)
              -) The argument 'x.gis.filename' was cahnged by 'x.gis' (a data.frame insteas of a character with the filename)
