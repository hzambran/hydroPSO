     -) New plot_results function, a wrapper to several plotting functions for reading all the results produced by hydroPSO
     -) New 'read_convergence' and 'plot_convergence' functions
     -) 'plotparam': thanks to Rodrigo Rojas'collaboration, this function was greatly improved, in order to get (almost) journal quality by default
     -) 'of-out.txt' changed to 'of_out.txt', in order to avoid problems with the symbol '-'
     -) 'PSO-logfile.txt' changed to 'PSO_logfile.txt', in order to avoid problems with the symbol '-'
     -) Particles.txt  : GoF is now writen as third column instead of as the last one
     -) Velocities.txt : GoF is now writen as third column instead of as the last one
     -) 'XtFitness.txt' was renamed to 'Particles_GofPerIter.txt'
     -) 'plotParticlesGof' was renamed to 'read.GofPerParticle'
                  
-) 28-Oct-2011  : 0.1-44. Added scientific notation for output files
-) 17-Oct-2011  : 0.1-43. Improved documentation to the PSO algorithm and small changes in the name of some control variables
-) 08-Oct-2011  : 0.1-42. Added documentation to the PSO algorithm
-) 05-Sep-2011  : 0.1-41. Added main title for 'plotparam', 'plotNparLines'
-) 01-Sep-2011  : 0.1-40.'plotparam': changed default columns and names for parameters
-) 24-Jun-2011  : parallel implementation with multi-core running with PSO and a hydrological model
-) May-2011     : Shuffling Evolution PSO working with generic hydromodel and generic goodness-of-fit function calls ('model.FUN' and 'model.FUN.args')
-) Apr-2011     : PSO 
-) 29-Dec-2010  : new method: IPSO
-) ~ 23-Dec-2010: Shuffling Evolution PSO working with test functions
-)     Dec-2010 : Shuffling Evolution PSO idea
-)     Nov-2010 : PSO working with hydrological models
-)  2009-Oct2010: hydroPSO hibernation :(
-)     Jul-2008 : canonical PSO working with some test functions
-) its name was changed to 'plot_NparOF'
